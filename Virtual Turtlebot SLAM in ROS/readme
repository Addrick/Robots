Virtual Turtlebot SLAM in ROS: Simulates a Turtlebot3 in Gazebo and RViz equipped with a LIDAR for environment sensing. Procedurally explores and maps as follows:

    Robot uses available distance information to synthesize a model of the world
    Using A*, travels towards a visible point closest to predetermined goal while avoiding obstacles
    Updates map after pathfinding, travels again towards destination
    If location is equidistant from destination or enclosed by walls, A* will try alternate paths
    Once location is discovered and reached, travels back to starting location
